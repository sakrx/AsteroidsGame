# AsteroidsGame
Game written in Java

Of the College Wide Learning Goals, this project fulfilled the critical thinking, creativity, and communication aspects. This is my first big project assignment 
my major. I was challenged to utilize creative ways of problem solving to finish this project. Moreover, navigating the code involved understanding object oriented 
programming concepts. I had to apply concepts taught in class to finish this project. I also developed my communication skills as I asked Greg for help on it.

Of the Computer Science department learning goals, I learned object oriented programming. I learned to work individually for the project. I also learned good
problem solving skills.
